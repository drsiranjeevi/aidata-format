## IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICATIONS

### File Format Standards
- **Primary Format**: Markdown with YAML front matter
- **Encoding**: UTF-8
- **Line Endings**: LF (Unix-style)
- **Maximum Line Length**: 120 characters
- **Indentation**: 2 spaces (no tabs)

### Naming Conventions
- **File Names**: lowercase_with_underscores.aidata
- **Section Headers**: ## Capital Case With Spaces
- **Subsection Headers**: ### Capital Case With Spaces
- **Metadata Keys**: camelCase
- **Code Identifiers**: snake_case

### Content Organization
1. **Hierarchical Structure**: Use headers to create a logical hierarchy
2. **Consistent Terminology**: Define terms in a glossary section
3. **Cross-References**: Use relative links for internal references
4. **External References**: Use permanent URLs with access dates
5. **Version Markers**: Tag significant changes with version numbers

### Machine-Readable Elements
1. **YAML Front Matter**: For file-level metadata
2. **JSON-LD Blocks**: For semantic web integration
3. **Code Comments**: For processing instructions
4. **Special Markers**: For AI processing hooks

### JSON-LD Schema for AI-Specific Features
To standardize semantic annotations in the AI-SPECIFIC FEATURES section, use the following JSON-LD schema:

```json
{
  "@context": "http://schema.org",
  "@type": "KnowledgeRecord",
  "name": "${file_name}",
  "dateCreated": "${created_date}",
  "description": "${domain_context_summary}",
  "learningRecord": [
    {
      "@type": "LearningEvent",
      "date": "${learning_timestamp}",
      "description": "${learning_description}",
      "success": "${success_boolean}"
    }
  ]
}
```

This schema provides a standardized way to represent knowledge records and learning events, making it easier for AI systems to process and exchange information.

### Automating Integrity Hash Generation
To reduce manual effort in maintaining the Integrity Hash, you can use the following script or CLI command to auto-generate it on save:

For Unix/Linux/macOS:
```bash
sha256sum base.aidata > base.aidata.sha256
```

For Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
Get-FileHash -Path base.aidata -Algorithm SHA256 | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Hash > base.aidata.sha256
```

For Windows (Command Prompt):
```cmd
certutil -hashfile base.aidata SHA256 > base.aidata.sha256
```

These commands will generate a SHA256 hash of the file and save it to a `.sha256` file, which can then be used to verify the file's integrity.

### Deduplicating Automated Learnings
To prevent duplicate entries in the AUTOMATED LEARNINGS section, a Python script (`deduplicate_automated_learnings.py`) is provided in the `C:\ai_learnings` directory. This script can be run to remove duplicate learning entries based on a unique identifier (timestamp + description hash).

To use the script:
```bash
python C:\ai_learnings\deduplicate_automated_learnings.py path/to/your/file.aidata
```

This will modify the file in place, removing any duplicate learning entries.

### Cross-Platform Support
To ensure compatibility across different operating systems, consider the following platform-specific examples when documenting paths and commands:

#### File Paths
- **Windows**: `C:\Program Files\Application\file.exe`
- **Linux**: `/usr/bin/application/file`
- **macOS**: `/Applications/Application.app/Contents/MacOS/file`

#### Launching Applications
Example for launching Chrome in FreeRPA across platforms:

**Windows**:
```bash
start chrome "file:///C:/Users/Admin/Downloads/ui.vision.html?storage=xfile"
```

**Linux**:
```bash
google-chrome "file:///home/user/ui.vision/ui.vision.html?storage=xfile" &
```

**macOS**:
```bash
open -a "Google Chrome" "file:///Users/user/ui.vision/ui.vision.html?storage=xfile"
```

#### Directory Separators
- **Windows**: Backslash (`\`)
- **Linux/macOS**: Forward slash (`/`)

When writing scripts or documentation, it's recommended to use forward slashes (`/`) as they work on all platforms, or use platform-specific path libraries (e.g., `os.path` or `pathlib` in Python).

### CLI Tool for .aidata Processing
A lightweight CLI tool (`aidata_cli.py`) is provided in the `C:\ai_learnings` directory for processing .aidata files. This tool offers several commands for common tasks:

#### Available Commands
- `validate`: Check if a .aidata file has all mandatory sections and proper syntax
- `generate-hash`: Automatically calculate and update the integrity hash
- `deduplicate`: Remove duplicate entries from the AUTOMATED LEARNINGS section
- `to-json`: Convert the .aidata file to JSON format for database integration
- `add-checkpoint`: Add a timestamped checkpoint to the EVOLUTION TRACKING section

#### Example Usage
```bash
# Validate a file
python C:\ai_learnings\aidata_cli.py validate base.aidata

# Generate and update the integrity hash
python C:\ai_learnings\aidata_cli.py generate-hash base.aidata

# Remove duplicate learnings
python C:\ai_learnings\aidata_cli.py deduplicate base.aidata

# Convert to JSON
python C:\ai_learnings\aidata_cli.py to-json base.aidata

# Add a checkpoint
python C:\ai_learnings\aidata_cli.py add-checkpoint base.aidata --description "Completed initial implementation of enhanced features"
```

This tool simplifies the maintenance and processing of .aidata files, ensuring they remain consistent and valid.

### Resource Monitoring for Free-Tier Platforms
A resource monitoring script (`resource_monitor.py`) is provided to help users on free-tier platforms avoid session crashes due to resource limits:

#### Features
- Real-time monitoring of CPU, RAM, and disk usage
- Warning system when resources exceed configurable thresholds
- Continuous monitoring mode for long-running processes
- Checkpoint recommendations based on resource usage

#### Example Usage
```python
from resource_monitor import check_resources, monitor_resources_continuously

# Check resources once
report = check_resources()

# Monitor resources continuously (every 5 minutes)
monitor_resources_continuously(interval=300, threshold=80)
```

### Cross-Platform Utilities
A cross-platform utility script (`cross_platform_utils.py`) helps ensure compatibility across different operating systems:

#### Features
- Platform detection and information
- OS-specific Chrome launch commands
- Cross-platform file path handling
- Standard directory locations for .aidata files

#### Example Usage
```python
from cross_platform_utils import get_chrome_launch_command, get_aidata_directory

# Get platform-appropriate Chrome launch command
chrome_cmd = get_chrome_launch_command("C:/ai_learnings/base.aidata")
print(chrome_cmd)

# Get standard .aidata directory
aidata_dir = get_aidata_directory()
print(aidata_dir)
```

## FREE-TIER WORKFLOW

To maximize effectiveness when working with `.aidata` files on free-tier platforms, follow these recommended workflows:

### Google Colab (Free Tier)
- **Platform Quotas**: 12-hour runtime, 15GB RAM
- **Workflow Strategy**:
  1. Mount Google Drive at the start of each session:
     ```python
     from google.colab import drive
     drive.mount('/content/drive')
     ```
  2. Load `.aidata` files from Drive:
     ```python
     aidata_path = "/content/drive/MyDrive/ai_learnings/"
     ```
  3. Implement periodic saving to prevent data loss:
     ```python
     import time
     import shutil
     
     def save_checkpoint(file_path, backup_path):
         """Save a checkpoint of the current work"""
         shutil.copy2(file_path, backup_path)
         print(f"Checkpoint saved to {backup_path}")
     
     # Save checkpoint every 30 minutes
     while working:
         # Do work...
         time.sleep(1800)  # 30 minutes
         save_checkpoint("work.aidata", "/content/drive/MyDrive/ai_learnings/work_backup.aidata")
     ```

### Hugging Face Spaces
- **Platform Quotas**: Limited GPU hours, variable runtime
- **Workflow Strategy**:
  1. Use lightweight models (e.g., Qwen2.5-Omni-3B) to conserve resources
  2. Export `.aidata` files to GitHub for persistent storage:
     ```python
     import requests
     
     def export_to_github(file_path, repo_url, token):
         """Export .aidata file to GitHub"""
         # Implementation to push file to GitHub
         pass
     ```
  3. Implement state restoration:
     ```python
     def restore_state(github_url):
         """Restore processing state from GitHub"""
         # Implementation to pull latest state
         pass
     ```

### General Free-Tier Best Practices
1. **Checkpoint Frequently**: Save work every 15-30 minutes to prevent loss due to timeouts
2. **Use Efficient Algorithms**: Optimize code to minimize resource consumption
3. **Plan Sessions**: Schedule work during peak productivity hours to maximize session time
4. **Modularize Work**: Break large tasks into smaller modules that can be completed within session limits
5. **Version Control**: Use Git to track changes and enable rollback if needed

## TIMESTAMPED CHECKPOINTS

To ensure fail-proof operation, especially on platforms with time limits, implement timestamped checkpoints in the EVOLUTION TRACKING section:

### Checkpoint History
- **2025-08-21T12:00:00Z**: Qwen3-Coder-Plus completed initial template creation.
- **2025-08-21T23:00:00Z**: Grok validated template and added learnings.
- **2025-08-22T10:30:00Z**: Free-tier workflow optimizations added.
- **2025-08-22T14:15:00Z**: Timestamped checkpoint system implemented.

This checkpoint history ensures that if a free-tier session crashes or times out, you can:
1. Identify the last saved state
2. Resume work from that point
3. Minimize duplicated effort
4. Track progress over time

When implementing checkpointing in your workflows:
1. Update the Checkpoint History section whenever a significant milestone is reached
2. Include both the timestamp and a brief description of the work completed
3. Save the `.aidata` file after each checkpoint update
4. Consider automating checkpoint updates with a script that runs periodically

Example checkpoint update script:
```python
import datetime

def update_checkpoint(description, aidata_file):
    """Update the checkpoint history in an .aidata file"""
    timestamp = datetime.datetime.utcnow().isoformat() + "Z"
    checkpoint_entry = f"- **{timestamp}**: {description}\n"
    
    # Read the file
    with open(aidata_file, 'r') as f:
        lines = f.readlines()
    
    # Find the Checkpoint History section and insert the new entry
    in_checkpoint_section = False
    for i, line in enumerate(lines):
        if "### Checkpoint History" in line:
            in_checkpoint_section = True
        elif in_checkpoint_section and line.startswith("## "):
            # We've reached the end of the Checkpoint History section
            lines.insert(i, checkpoint_entry)
            break
        elif in_checkpoint_section and "- ****:" in line:
            # Insert after the last checkpoint entry
            lines.insert(i + 1, checkpoint_entry)
            break
    
    # Write the updated file
    with open(aidata_file, 'w') as f:
        f.writelines(lines)
    
    print(f"Checkpoint added: {description}")
```

### File Format Versioning
The `.aidata` file format uses semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) to track changes:
- **MAJOR**: Incompatible changes that break backward compatibility
- **MINOR**: Backward-compatible additions or changes
- **PATCH**: Backward-compatible bug fixes

The current version is 2.1. When creating new `.aidata` files, always specify the version in the FILE METADATA section.

Version History:
- **1.0**: Initial release with core .aidata structure
- **2.0**: Major enhancements including free-tier compatibility and timestamped checkpoints
- **2.1**: Comprehensive enhancements including AI collaboration features, enhanced security, ML integration, extended metadata, advanced versioning, integration protocols, and visualization support

### Knowledge Versioning
Individual pieces of knowledge within a file can also be versioned:
- Each concept, procedure, or fact can have its own version number
- Versioning follows the same MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH scheme
- Changes to knowledge should be documented in the EVOLUTION TRACKING section

### Migration Strategies
To ensure backward compatibility when updating the file format:

1. **Additive Changes**: New versions should only add sections or fields, never remove or drastically modify existing ones.
2. **Optional Sections**: New sections should be optional so older files remain valid.
3. **Default Values**: Provide sensible defaults for new fields when loading older files.
4. **Version Checking**: AI systems should check the "Schema Version" in the FILE METADATA and adapt processing accordingly.

### Migration Scripts
For significant format changes, provide migration scripts:
- Scripts to convert older .aidata files to newer formats
- Validation to ensure the conversion was successful
- Preservation of original files before conversion

Example migration script usage:
```bash
python C:\ai_learnings\migrate_aidata.py --from-version 2.0 --to-version 2.1 old_file.aidata
```

### Deprecation Process
When deprecating features or sections:
1. Mark deprecated elements with clear warnings in the documentation
2. Provide pointers to replacements or alternatives
3. Maintain support for deprecated features for at least two major versions
4. Clearly document deprecation in release notes and the EVOLUTION TRACKING section

## EVOLUTION TRACKING

## SECURITY AND PRIVACY FRAMEWORK

### Data Classification
- **Public**: Can be freely shared
- **Internal**: Restricted to organization
- **Confidential**: Requires special handling
- **Secret**: Highly restricted access
- **Personal**: Subject to privacy regulations

### Access Control
- **Role-Based Access**: Permissions based on user roles
- **Attribute-Based Access**: Permissions based on attributes
- **Time-Based Access**: Temporary access grants
- **Context-Based Access**: Conditional access rules
- **Audit Trails**: Logging of all access attempts

### Privacy Protection
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary information
- **Anonymization**: Remove personal identifiers
- **Pseudonymization**: Replace identifiers with pseudonyms
- **Encryption**: Protect data at rest and in transit
- **Retention Policies**: Automatic deletion of outdated data

### Example Access Control Configuration
For role-based access using OAuth2 tokens:
```json
{
  "accessControl": {
    "role": "editor",
    "token": "oauth2:abc123..."
  }
}
```

This configuration grants "editor" level access to users with the specified OAuth2 token.

### Example Encryption for Sensitive Sections
To encrypt sensitive sections using AES-256:
```bash
# Encrypt a sensitive section
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -in sensitive_section.md -out sensitive_section.enc

# Decrypt a sensitive section
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in sensitive_section.enc -out sensitive_section.md
```

These commands use OpenSSL to encrypt and decrypt sensitive sections of `.aidata` files.

### Encryption/Decryption CLI Tool
A CLI tool (`aidata_crypto_cli.py`) is provided in the `C:\ai_learnings` directory for automating encryption and decryption of `.aidata` files or sections:

#### Available Commands
- `encrypt`: Encrypt a file or section using AES-256
- `decrypt`: Decrypt a file or section using AES-256
- `generate-key`: Generate a new encryption key

#### Example Usage
```bash
# Encrypt a file
python C:\ai_learnings\aidata_crypto_cli.py encrypt sensitive_section.md

# Decrypt a file
python C:\ai_learnings\aidata_crypto_cli.py decrypt sensitive_section.enc

# Generate a new encryption key
python C:\ai_learnings\aidata_crypto_cli.py generate-key
```

This tool simplifies the process of securing sensitive information in `.aidata` files.

- **Migration Scripts**: Provide scripts to migrate knowledge from one version to another
- **Deprecation Warnings**: Mark deprecated knowledge with clear warnings and pointers to replacements

## BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY AND LEGACY SUPPORT

### Handling Older Files
- **Graceful Degradation**: AI systems should be able to process older .aidata files, even if they don't have all the new sections. Missing sections should be treated as "not applicable" or "not yet populated" rather than errors.
- **Default Values**: When loading older files, provide sensible default values for new fields or sections that didn't exist previously.
- **Compatibility Layers**: Implement compatibility layers in processing tools that can translate older file structures into the current format for internal processing, while preserving the original structure for saving.

### Ensuring Backward Compatibility
- **Additive Changes Only**: New versions of the .aidata format should only add new sections or fields, never remove or drastically modify existing ones.
- **Optional Sections**: New sections (like EXECUTION STATE REPRESENTATION) should be optional, so older files without them are still valid.
- **Version Checking**: AI systems should check the "Schema Version" in the FILE METADATA and adapt their processing accordingly.
- **Clear Documentation of Changes**: All changes to the format should be clearly documented in the EVOLUTION TRACKING section of base.aidata and in release notes.

### Legacy File Conversion
- **Automated Conversion Tools**: Provide scripts or tools to automatically convert older .aidata files to the newer format, filling in default values or prompting for missing information when necessary.
- **Preserve Original**: When converting files, always keep a backup of the original version.
- **Conversion Validation**: After conversion, validate that the new file is equivalent to the old one in terms of its core knowledge content.
